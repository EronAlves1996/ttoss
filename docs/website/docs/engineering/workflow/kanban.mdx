We use the [Kanban](https://arantespp.com/zettel/kanban) to delivery high-quality value to our customers, on time and on budget.
We chose [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) as our project management tool because it enables our cross-functional teams to work together in a single place, and share the entire project lifecycle with every team member.

## Team's high-level routine

The engineering team follow a high-level routine for producing value to our customers, whose steps are:

1. **Backlog**: we add not started tasks to the engineering backlog. These tasks come from design, product, or other teams or new substasks.

1. **Specify**: we specify the work necessary to complete the task. Generally, we split the task into smaller tasks that can be completed in a single day. We also add the new subtasks to the backlog.

1. **Implement**: we implement the task, together with tests, technical or customer documentation, and other necessary artifacts. We also check if it meets the requirements on development environment.

1. **Deploy**: we release the work to Staging and Production environments. We also check if the implementation works properly on these environments.

## Kanban board

Now that we defined the [team's high-level routine](#teams-high-level-routine), let's define the statuses of the Kanban board and the rules for moving tasks between them.

### Statuses

The Kanban board has the following statuses (the value in parentheses represents its [high-level routine step](#teams-high-level-routine)):

1. **BACKLOG** (Backlog): not started tasks.
1. **SPECIFY** (Specify): tasks to be specified.
1. **READY TO START** (Specify): specified tasks ready to be implemented.
1. **IMPLEMENTING** (Implement): tasks being implemented.
1. **TRACKING** (Implement): tasks that are blocked by something external to the team.
1. **TEAM ACCEPTANCE** (Implement): tasks that was implemented and were/are being validated by the team on Development environment.
1. **CHECK DEPLOYMENT** (Deploy): tasks that were automatically released (continuous delivery) and need to be validated on Staging and Production environments.
1. **DEPLOYED** (Deploy): tasks that were released validated on Staging and Production environments.
1. **COMPLETE** (Done): complete tasks.
